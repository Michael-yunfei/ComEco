# Computational Economics


This repo is built for my developing course - applied computational economics. Right now, it's more like a miscellany. My plan is to collect everything of relevant and I think it's useful here, then I can organize or split them into different sub-courses.

Here is the content of this repo:

* Learning Python: from beginner to expert
* Computation Basic: numerical methods and scientific programming
* Applied Computational Economics and Finance
