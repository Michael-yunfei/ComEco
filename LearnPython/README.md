# Learn Python

Here is the book I followed:

* Guttag, J., 2016. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data. MIT Press.

* Slatkin, B., 2015. Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python. Pearson Education.

* Open online documents of packages: Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib...

All code and tipis are built up progressively in the following way:

1 - Introduction: get yourself familiar with basic structure of programming, like for loop;
2 - Beginner's practice: learn data structure and their attributes;
3 - Beginner's practice: learn how to use packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib
4 - Effective level: classes and objected-oriented programming
5 - Effective level: python thinking, such as metaclasses and parallelism, etc.
6 - Becoming an expert: what does it mean to become a software engineering?
7 - Becoming an expert: develop your own packages and maintain them.
